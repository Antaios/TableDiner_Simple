# TableDiner
A Tiny XML patch to increase the pawn table search radius from 25 to 60.

Lots of people complain about pawns getting the "Ate without table" debuff too often, The cause is generally that their table is just too far away from where the colonists grab their food.

The vanilla game searches for a table up to 25 tiles from where a pawn grabs food, This XML Patch increases that radius to a more reasonable 60 tiles. So pawns no longer refuse to eat at the table unless they're actually a decent distance away, instead of refusing to go into the room next door.

To edit the searh radius yourself, edit the number in Patches/Patches_TableDiner.xml
